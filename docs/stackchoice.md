CS 411 Team 9 - Assignment 3 Deliverable

For our movie database project, the two stacks we were debating between were Node.js and Flask. After looking into our potential APIâ€™s and thinking about our future plans with this project, we ended up going with Flask for two big reasons. The first being the flexibility and compatibility with various APIs and the second being the ease of setting up. 

Initially, while we were looking at most APIs we realized that Node and Flask were both compatible with most APIs, however from our research it seemed like Node.js required already existing libraries with extensive code to handle the APIs. On the other hand Flask was a lot easier to integrate with APIs. Given that we may end up incorporating other APIs we decided it would be best for us to go with Flask.

Secondly it was much easier to set up the flask in comparison to Node.js. Given that a majority of our team was already exposed to flask we knew what it would take in order to start up a project, thus reducing the time spent to learn and implement a brand new stack. Since we all have experience in python (and because it is generally easier to write and understand), the learning time here would also be less significant. It was also noted in our research that Flask could be set up in a matter of minutes, whereas Node.js would require a little bit more extensive coding and knowledge of javascript in order to properly set up the infrastructure for our project.
